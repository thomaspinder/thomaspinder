### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Applied Scientist at Amazon working on causal analysis. Previously, I completed a PhD in Statistics titled _Developments in Gaussian processes with applications to climate science and network problems_. I am interested in Gaussian processes, network models, and causal inference.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on non-stationary causal analysis
- ðŸ™Œ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on [GPJax]([https://github.com/thomaspinder/GPJax](https://github.com/JaxGaussianProcesses/GPJax))
