### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third year PhD student in Statistics at [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/). I have spent time as an Applied Scientist at Amazon and a Machine Learning Scientist at MindFoundry. I am interested in Gaussian processes, network modelling and approximate inference.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on embedding networks using Gaussian processes
- ðŸ™Œ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on [GPJax](https://github.com/thomaspinder/GPJax)
